## Exercises: Variety Pack

1. Given the following declarations

   ```haskell
   k (x, y) = x
   k1 = k ((4-1), 10)
   k2 = k ("three", (1 + 2))
   k3 = k (3, True)
   ```

   1. What is the type of `k`?
      **Answer**:

       ```haskell
       k :: (a, b) => a
       ```

   2. What is the type of `k2`? Is it the same type as `k1` or `k3`?
      **Answer**:

      ```haskell
      k1 :: Num a => a
      k2 :: [Char]
      k3 :: Num a => a
      ```

   3. Of `k1`, `k2`, `k3`, which will return the number `3` as the result?
      **Answer**: `k1` and `k3`

2. Fill in the definition of the following function:

   ```haskell
   -- Remember: Tuples have the same syntax for their
   -- type constructors and their data constructors.

   f :: (a, b, c) -> (d, e, f) -> ((a, d), (c, f))
   f = undefined
   ```
   **Answer**: 

   ```haskell
   f (a, b, c) (d, e, f) = ((a, d), (c, f))
   ```
